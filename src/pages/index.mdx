## Free Tutoring!

Starting June 3, 2024, I will be offering **free** math tutoring at the [Sumas Library](https://www.wcls.org/about-wcls/#su) every Monday @3pm in partnership with the [Whatcom County Library System](https://www.wcls.org/).

While my specialty is in middle & high school mathematics, this opportunity is available to learners of all ages.

- Just learned what numbers are and still have baby teeth?
  - _Come on in!_
- Struggled with math ever since letters started showing up?
  - _I got you!_
- Life got in the way and you are now a parent of 4 taking night classes?
  - _You are exactly who I want to teach!_

To be clear, I want to help 7th graders pass their class. I want to help high schooler's crush the ACT math section. I want to help parents who struggle to keep up with the "new math". I want to help the adolescent and adult learners needing an extra bit of help with remote/home schooling.

Let me help you...for free. [Learn more about me.](/about)
