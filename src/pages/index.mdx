## Free Math Tutoring!

Starting June 3, 2024, I will be offering **free** math tutoring at the [Sumas Library](https://www.wcls.org/about-wcls/#su) every Monday @3pm in partnership with the [Whatcom County Library System](https://www.wcls.org/).

`Find out more!`

Math is worth knowing, and things worth knowing shouldn't be miserable to learn.
