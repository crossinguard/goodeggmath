# {frontmatter.title}

Starting June 3, 2024, I will be offering **free** math tutoring at the [Sumas Library](https://www.wcls.org/about-wcls/#su) in partnership with the [Whatcom County Library System](https://www.wcls.org/).

While my specialty is in middle & high school mathematics, this opportunity is available to learners of all ages, above and below.

Just show up with something to write with, something to write on, and any worksheets, textbooks, or materials you wish to go over. As we get to know each other we will formulate a week-to-week plan. See you there!

- Just learned what numbers are and still have baby teeth?
- _Come on in!_
- Been struggling with math ever since letters started showing up?
- _I got you!_
- Life got in the way and you are now a parent of 4 taking night classes?
- _You are exactly who I want to teach!_
