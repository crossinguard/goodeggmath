I am an experienced math teacher ([find out more](/about)) offering both **free** and **paid** math tutoring services. While my specialty is in middle & high school mathematics, this opportunity is available to learners of all ages, above and below.

## Free Tutoring

Starting June 3, 2024, I will be offering **free** math tutoring at the [Sumas Library](https://www.wcls.org/about-wcls/#su) in partnership with the [Whatcom County Library System](https://www.wcls.org/). This will occur every Monday from 3:00 - 4:30 pm and is available to learners of all ages and backgrounds.

### How does the free tutoring session work?

Just show up to the Sumas library with something to write with, something to write on, and any worksheets, textbooks, or materials you wish to go over. As we get to know each other we will formulate a week-to-week plan.

I encourage anyone planning to attend to [send me an email (brett@goodeggmath.com)](mailto:brett@goodeggmath.com). You can introduce yourself, or even give me a heads up on the class/content you might need help with. I'll prep for your specific problem if you let me!

### Free free? As in no cost?

That is correct! Full disclosure, I (_will_) offer paid tutoring outside of this time slot. I hope you like what I do and want to pay me for more time/help/expertise. But this free weekly tutoring time is donated by me to serve my community, promote my local library, and promote myself. I do it to stay connected to the world of math education. I loved being a teacher, and am excited to create math learning paths on my own terms. Tutoring is only the beginning!

## Paid Tutoring

COMING SOON!

I will be providing paid tutoring services in the coming months, using the 2024 summer as a "soft launch" to be ready for the upcoming school year. This website and my availability, fees, and processes are still under development (soft launch!). Concrete information to be made available soon.

### In-person tutoring

I plan to start with paid **in-person tutoring**, ideally meeting at neutral ground. That means not my house, not your house, but somewhere we can just be comfortable and be our mathy selves. Where that specifically is will be updated here once I can answer that question, but think park, school, library, city building, coffee shop, or something along those lines.

In-person tutoring will likely be limited to the PNW of the PNW, aka the top corner of Whatcom County. If you are in the Nooksack Valley area, then I think we can hang out some time and talk mathematical operations and other radical things.

### Remote online tutoring

The next step will be to add paid **remote online tutoring**. This will likely take place on Discord, or another equivalent service that can handle voice calls and shared screens. My classroom was always a digitally-forward environment, benefitting from my tech curiosity and desire to find a better way to do outdated processes. Mix in my experience as an assessment developer for an entirely remote university with my current web development obsession and I think we will be able to build something pretty unique. Stay turned for more information, but like I said, tutoring is only the beginning!

Remote online tutoring will be available to (realistically) anybody, no matter your physical location.
