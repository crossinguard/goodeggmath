I am an experienced math teacher ([find out more](/about)) offering **free** math tutoring services to my local community here in Whatcom County. While my specialty is in middle & high school mathematics, this opportunity is available to learners of all ages, above and below.

Starting in June 2024, I began offering **free** math tutoring at the Sumas Library in partnership with the [Whatcom County Library System](https://www.wcls.org/). During the first few months, patrons were encourged to drop in as needed with math questions. In order make the best use of everyone's time, the format eventually evolved to require an appointment. 

## Free Tutoring

### How do I sign up?

Unfortunately my schedule no longer allows me to offer free math tutoring to my community, but I hope to one day offer this again.

~~Visit my appointment page at REDACTED to check my availability and schedule a time to meet. Sessions are available on Mondays & Wednesdays from 3pm - 6pm (30 or 60 minutes) on any day the Sumas Library is open. Time slots are limited and on a first-come, first-serve basis.~~

### How does the free tutoring session work?

At the time of your scheduled appointment, just show up to the Sumas Library with something to write on, something to write with, and any worksheets, textbooks, or materials you wish to go over. As we get to know each other we will formulate a more specific plan. I'll prep for your specific needs if you let me!

### Free free? As in no cost?

That is correct! Full disclosure, I am considering paid tutoring outside of this time slot. I hope you like what I do and want to pay me for more time/help/expertise. But this free weekly tutoring time is donated by me to serve my community, promote my local library, and promote myself. I do it to stay connected to the world of math education. I loved being a teacher, and am excited to create math learning paths on my own terms. Tutoring is only the beginning!
