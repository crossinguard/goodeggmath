Numbers, like most things in life, can be categorized. The context tells us what type of categories we care about.

For example, when looking at bank transactions we see positive numbers when money comes in, and negative numbers when money goes out. The categories we care about are based on a positive vs. a negative number, and tyically the numbers have decimal values. 

Math has several pre-existing number categories. These categories can be thought of as "data types", a core idea in the world of coding and data analytics. The pre-existing data types you are likely to encounter are 

- `natural`
- `whole`
- `integer`
- `rational`
- `irrational`
- `real`
- `imaginary`
- `complex`
