`good egg math` is a series of free digital learning paths meant to help students of any situation learn mathematics.

## Who is the instructor?

My name is Brett Egbert. I am an educator and lifelong learner.

I began my professional career teaching high school math right as the [Common Core](https://www.thecorestandards.org/) took hold in secondary education. As a first year teacher I hit the ground running, helping to redesign long-established curriculum to meet the new standards. With nearly a decade of classroom teaching experience, I have designed, iterated, & redesigned hundreds of math lessons in alignment with district content requirements. I have built countless original supporting instructional materials (e.g., video lessons, learning activities, lecture presentations) and both formative & summative assessments to measure student competency. I have provided direct instruction to thousands of students across my teaching journey, both in person and remotely.

When I left the classroom behind, I joined an online university as an entirely remote employee. The transition from classroom teacher to non-classroom _anything_ can be a jarring path. I dipped my toes into the non-teacher life by first helping to evaluate student teacher capstone portfolios. I then shifted into program development, tasked with designing university-level courses & assessments for IT degree programs. Designing performance tasks and summative assessments in Python, SQL, and Java ignited my interest in coding.

I continued my learning journey by upskilling into data analytics and web development. I benefited greatly from high quality, free education made available by experienced data professionals and front-end developers. Unlike the digital and physical textbooks I had experienced as both a teacher and as a student, these modern learning paths were _made_ for the web. Coders teaching others to code using modern presentation tools with accessibility in mind. It is with these skills that I now revisit mathematics education.

Education has always felt very "pencil and paper", with even digital materials confined to the physical requirements of a classroom experience. Digital textbooks are often slow, tedious affairs with subpar images, poor accessibility, questionable interactivity, and do not inspire curiosity. I hope to provide a new mathematics learning resource that provides an alternate route to education for learners seeking a different approach.

I am making this for the teachers who pay for classroom supplies out of pocket. I am making this so learners can rediscover a joy in mathematics destroyed by a bad experience back in middle school. I am making this to help parents feel comfortable saying "I don't know the answer, but I know where we can go to get help" during a late night homework session.

Math is worth knowing, and things worth knowing shouldn't be miserable to learn.
